# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate Projects

- ## [Course 1 (Exploartory Data Analysis for Machine Learning)](https://github.com/1brahimmohamed/IBM-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%202%20-%20Supervised%20ML%20(Regression)/Project)

    Machine Learning Introduction and the content of the professional certificate. In this course you realize the importance of good, quality data. You learn common techniques to retrieve your data, clean it, apply feature engineering, and have it ready for preliminary analysis and hypothesis testing.

    Retrieve data from multiple data sources: SQL, NoSQL databases, APIs, Cloud. 
    Describe and use common feature selection and feature engineering techniques
    Handle categorical and ordinal features, as well as missing values
    Use a variety of techniques for detecting and dealing with outliers
    Articulate why feature scaling is important and use a variety of scaling techniques

- ## [Course 2 (Regression) Project - Medical Insurance Charges Prediction](https://github.com/1brahimmohamed/IBM-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%202%20-%20Supervised%20ML%20(Regression)/Project)

    Differentiate uses and applications of classification and regression in the context of supervised machine learning.
    Describe and use linear regression models
    Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select a linear regression model that best suits your data.
    Articulate why regularization may help prevent overfitting.
    Use regularization regressions: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic net.


    ### Project 
    - This analysis' primary goal is to predict the Insurance Charges using a linear regression and other regularisation regressions.
    - This investigation tries train-test-split and cross-validation to get an idea of how these two strategies can influence model selection in different ways.
    - Show the correlation between the features and the target predicted value and the most feature with impact on it.




- ## [Course 3 (Classification) Project - Heart Diseases Prediction](https://github.com1brahimmohamed/IBM-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Course%203%20-%20Supervised%20ML%20(Classification))

    Differentiate uses and applications of classification and classification ensembles.
    Describe and use logistic regression models.
    Describe and use decision tree and tree-ensemble models.
    Describe and use other ensemble methods for classification.
    Use a variety of error metrics to compare and select the classification model that best suits your data.
    Use oversampling and undersampling as techniques to handle unbalanced classes in a data set.

    ### Project 
    - This analysis' primary goal is to predict the occurrence of cardiac muscle disease using various classification techniques
    - This investigation tries train-test-split and cross-validation to get an idea of how these two strategies can influence model selection in different ways.
    - Show the correlation between the features and the target predicted value and the most feature with impact on it.


- ## [Course 4 (Unsupervised) Project - Bank Customers Segementation]()

    Explain the kinds of problems suitable for Unsupervised Learning approaches.
    Explain the curse of dimensionality, and how it makes clustering difficult with many features.
    Describe and use common clustering and dimensionality-reduction algorithms.
    Try clustering points where appropriate, compare the performance of per-cluster models.
    Understand metrics relevant for characterizing clusters.

    ### Project 
    - This analysis' primary goal is to cluster bank customers into groups and validate if they are potential customer for term deposit.
    - So clustering is the main target analysis for unsupervised learning
    - Show the correlation between the features & the most features with impact.
    - Validate the clusters with binary classification.



- ## [Course 5 (Reinforcement & Deep Learning) Project - ]()
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
